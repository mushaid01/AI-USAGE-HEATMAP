# 📊 AI Usage Heatmap: Visualize Your Productivity with AI! 🤖

**Transform your AI interactions into stunning visualizations.** This project helps you generate **heatmaps** of your AI usage over time, making it easy to track and analyze your productivity trends. Inspired by the amazing work of **Chip Huyen**, this tool is designed to provide a deeper understanding of how AI fits into your daily workflow.

## 🌟 Features  

✅ **Dynamic Heatmaps**: Generate beautiful heatmaps for your AI usage across specific time periods.  
✅ **Custom Time Range**: Analyze data from the past 3 years or customize the date range.  
✅ **Clear Visuals**: Identify peak productivity days and patterns in your AI interactions.  
✅ **Interactive Design**: Built using Python and Matplotlib for a seamless experience.  
✅ **Easy Integration**: Works with data from any timestamp-based logging system.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Input Data**: Provide your conversation logs with timestamps in a compatible format (e.g., JSON, CSV).  
2. **Process Data**: The script converts timestamps to localized datetime objects and filters them by year.  
3. **Generate Heatmap**: Visualize your usage patterns with a weekly calendar layout.
